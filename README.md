# combat
A referee tool for determining damage during combat in the game Traveller

Run in the terminal. UPP is 6 characters which denote stats (strength, dexterity, endurance, intelligence, education, social standing).
The UPP can be the numbers 1-9 or letters A-F which are equal to 10-15.
The program runs in combat rounds, so first enter the names, UPP, and armor of each fighter, then enter a combat round by giving the names of only two fighters and the weapon used. Dice rolls are simulated automatically and damage dealt by decrementing a random one of the physical characteristics.
